User Manual 
 The purpose of the User Manual assignment is to encourage you to provide your 
sponsor and other users with clear and complete information on the dependencies for, 
how to use, and administer your project. This section assumes that your product 
consists primarily of standalone software. If your project is of a different nature, then 
you will need to restructure the user manual appropriately. 
 The best advice to write the manual, is to assume you know nothing about the project. 
If someone handed you the project, what would you want to know to be able to install 
it, use it, and maintain/update it. Assume no project will be hosted on Turing forever. 
Dependencies 
 The user manual should explain how to obtain, install, and configure your project on 
a computer system. As appropriate for your project, consider the following issues: 
• What does your product need as an operating environment/system?  
 
• What are its dependencies: software platforms, languages, tools, packages, 
libraries, frameworks, type of database, files, game engine, specialized 
hardware components, etc. 
 
• If applicable: How does the user build (e.g., compile, link) your product? 
Describe how to use any build scripts you provide. 
 
• If there is a database, for an SQL structure provide the statement/s that creates 
the database/tables, constraints, etc., for a NoSQL structure provide the schema 
 
• Where is the current host site (for applications or databases), where can a game 
be obtained to play, where can project code be obtained? 
 
Use 
 The user manual should clearly describe the user interface structure and functionality. 
This could contain images either for User Interfaces (Websites, Apps, etc..) or it could 
be about producing different or adjusting current graphs. As appropriate for your 
project, consider the following issues: 
• What are the different types of users (e.g., administrator, staff, customer, 
general public, etc.)? What are the different needs of each? 
 
• Is your product accessible to users with physical challenges? 
 Some of these features can, of course, be partially handled within the user interface 
itself (website, Mobile app, Data Science studios, etc.) by providing an intuitive user 
interface design, informative error messages and warnings, built-in help facilities, etc. 
But separate documentation may be needed for some aspects. 
Administration and Maintenance 
 Assume your product requires routine maintenance or administrative tasks not 
covered above under “Use”, describe those in this section. Dataset’s change (as the 
years change) or are updated with new information. Hosting sites go out of business 
or are no longer free for use, what is needed for the site to move to a new hosting 
service.  
 Similarly, you also want to include a section that discusses how to enhance and 
extend the product and suggests possible enhancements. 
 
Assignment Submission and Assessment 
 Prepare your user manual in an appropriate format for the users of your product.  
 
 Submit a PDF file to Blackboard by the due date.  
 
 During evaluation of your product, the instructor and other evaluators will examine 
your user manual to run your program. They will determine the viability of your 
project by how much difficulty they have using your program with your set of 
instructions. Remember the instructor will make no assumptions about the machine or 
the program. They will do just what this document tells him to do.
